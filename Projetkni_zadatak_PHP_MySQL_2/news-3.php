			<h2>Setting Up an Automatic The drippers System for Outdoor Plants & Hanging Baskets.</h2>
			<p class="description">Setting up an automatic The drippers system for outdoor plants and hanging baskets using drip irrigation is easier than you might think. Once you have one, you will wonder how you ever managed without it!</p>
			<p>Setting up the automatic watering system for outdoor plants & hanging baskets is as easy as running one long piece of the included black supply tubing to extend along the back of your pots, and then attaching off-shoots to each pot.</p>
			<p>One end of the tubing should attach to the timer/ faucet, and the other end should reach as far as the last pot you want to water. I was able to use a pair of cutting pliers to easily snip through the plastic tubing to get the lengths I needed.</p>
			<p>After you have the length of the tubing stretched out to reach each pot, it s time to attach connectors to run to each individual pot. All of the connectors needed (plus extras!) are included with the kit.
                Simply snip the supply line behind each pot, and add a tee connector that will attach a separate line running to each pot.</p>
			<p>The kit even includes mounting clamps and nails, which are likely meant for attaching the tubing to your covered porch for hanging plants, but I used them to attach the tubing to my whiskey barrels since they are so big and high off the ground.
                 If you were using this system for smaller potted plants, you wouldnt need the mounting clamps.</p>
			<p>The instructions say that if you have a pot “smaller than 1 foot wide”, one dripper is recommended per pot, and pots “larger than 1 foot wide” should use two drippers.
                Since my barrels are large, I used a second tee bracket to add two drippers to each pot. I included fairly long pieces of tubing (about 12 inches each) for each dripper so that I can have the flexibility of moving the drippers around in the pot exactly where I want them..</p>
			<p>After all my tubing and drip heads were in place, I added my herbs and then used the included support stakes to situate each drip head near the base of the plants.All that was left then was to set the timer. The included timer allows you to set both the frequency of watering, as well as the run time. It even includes a bypass dial if rain is expected, and you want to skip watering for 24-72 hours.
                The drippers put out 1/2 gallon of water per hour, so I currently have mine set to water 3 times per day (every 8 hours) for 10 minutes at a time.</p>

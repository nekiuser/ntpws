		<p>Analysis and research show that summers are becoming hotter with less rainfall on an annual basis since the beginning of the year 2000, experiencing a 29% increase. Droughts account for 15% of natural disasters, causing approximately 650,000 deaths from 1970 to 2019. From 1998 to 2017, droughts resulted in global economic losses of around 124 billion dollars. The most affected plants by drought include houseplants, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and medicinal herbs.</p>
		<p>Hidrosense is the most affordable and effective way of irrigating a wide range of horticultural, agricultural, and fruit crops. It is a smart irrigation system designed for all farmers as well as activities related to municipal and horticultural practices.</p>
		<p>The key feature of this product is the moisture sensors integrated within the system, enabling optimal water release based on the current needs. This function allows for maximum utilization of available water resources, shifting the focus from daily irrigation concerns to water conservation. Plants grow in conditions that are tailored to their specific needs, resulting in optimal outcomes and significant savings.</p>
		<p>It operates through thin-walled pipes with drip emitters. Each emitter is equipped with a built-in microfilter that prevents clogging and the entry of impurities when the pipe is empty or during precipitation. The embedded membranes in the emitters ensure uniform water delivery along the entire length of the pipe, regardless of pressure changes and over long distances. It consists of moisture sensors and possesses manual control functionality (OPEN-AUTO-CLOSE). Closing the emitters when there is no water in the pipe prevents soil, dirt, and insects from entering.</p>
		<p>The installation is above ground, and the soil can be covered with wood chips or similar materials to prevent evaporation, weed growth, and pests. It connects to a separate above-ground water source, eliminating the need for extensive construction work, and can be retrofitted to existing crops. If used in potted plants, it can be easily and quickly installed in the ground. All components are easily replaceable and made of materials resistant to acids and UV radiation.</p>
		<p>The product is available at garden and agricultural centers, as well as on the official Hidrosense website.</p>

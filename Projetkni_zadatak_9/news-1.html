			<h2>Principle of operation of self-watering vases</h2>
			<p class="description">Hidrosense H2O system is designed to handle plants in a way that makes plant care easier for the end user.</p>
			<p>The water level indicator shows the current state in the tank. The main transfer of liquid to the roots is done via clay balls, which absorb water up to 80% of their volume and protect the roots from rotting, because they are also breathable. Ultimately, this technology makes it possible to avoid drying out the plants as well as avoiding excessive watering.</p>
			<p>Watering is done through the liquid level indicator. You can already mix the liquid fertilizer. We recommend liquid Florabella. Pour the liquid until the float shows the max level. Close the lid.</p>
			<p>Adding clay balls. Add at least a liter of clay balls. We recommend Laterlite clay balls. They absorb liquid up to 80% of their volume. They also make the root airy and allow the root veins to expand into themselves. With osmosis, they extract the liquid from the water tank and distribute it to the roots of the plant.</p>
			<p>Now add the substrate or soil for the flowers. We recommend Florabella soil.</p>
			<p>Plant flowers in a planter. Make sure that the soil level is not at the very top of the pot, so that the water does not spill out.</p>
			<p>All planters have a screw-shaped cap at the bottom of the planter. You can tighten the plug with a coin if the planter is used in the house on the furniture, then it must be thoroughly plugged.</p>
